Imagine you're facing a control box from outside the dome.
The first six strands are identified as follows:

B  \   /  C
A -- x -- D
F  /   \  E

G is the extension strand that goes over A, and
H is the extension strand that goes over C.

The rx Natboard on the left in the control box handles strands
1-4 from left to right, and the Natboard on the right handles
strands 5-8 from left to right.

The mapping between strands and the Natboard slots is as follows:
Natboard slot   Strand
1               E
2               B
3               H
4               D
5               C
6               A
7               F
8               G
